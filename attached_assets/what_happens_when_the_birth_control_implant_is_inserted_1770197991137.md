A doctor or nurse uses a special device to place the implant under the skin of your arm. Insertion is really fast and they’ll numb your arm so it won’t hurt.


### Want the implant?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How is the implant inserted?

First, your doctor or nurse will ask you some questions about your health to see if the implant — also called Nexplanon — is a good method for you. They may also give you a physical exam.

The doctor or nurse gives you a shot to numb a small area of your arm. Then, they use a special inserter tool to slide the implant under your skin.  Putting the implant in only takes a few minutes.


## How does it feel to get an implant inserted?

Most people just feel a little pinch or stinging when they get the numbing shot. After that, you shouldn’t be able to feel the implant being inserted. After the pain medication has worn off, your arm may ache a little where the implant was inserted, but it goes away quickly.

You may have some tenderness or swelling around the implant for a few days and it may look bruised for a week or two. Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to wash and take care of the skin around your implant for the first couple of days.


## How soon after getting the implant can I have sex?

You can have sex right away after getting the implant, but you may need to use backup birth control (like condoms) for the first week.

If you get the implant within the first 5 days of your period, you’re protected from pregnancy right away.

If you get the implant at any other time in your cycle, use another type of birth control (like condoms) for the next 7 days if you have vaginal sex.
