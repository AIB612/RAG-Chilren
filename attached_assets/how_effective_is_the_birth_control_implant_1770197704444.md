### Want the implant?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How effective is the implant?

The implant is one of the best birth control methods out there — it’s more than 99% effective. That means fewer than 1 out of 100 people who use Nexplanon will get pregnant each year. It doesn’t get much better than that.

The implant is so effective because there's no chance of making a mistake. Since it’s in your arm, you can’t forget to take it, or use it incorrectly. It protects you from pregnancy all day, every day for up to 5 years. If you decide you want to get pregnant, a nurse or doctor can take it out and you can get pregnant right away.

The implant doesn’t protect you from STDs, so use condoms along with the implant to help protect you from both pregnancy and STDs. That’s how you make sex worry-free.


## How long does it take for the birth control implant to work?

If you get Nexplanon during the first 5 days of your period, you’re protected from pregnancy right away.

If you get the implant at any other time in your cycle, use some other form of birth control (like condoms) during the first week. After that first week, the implant starts working and you’re protected from pregnancy for up to 5 years. That’s why it’s called get-it-and-forget-it birth control.


## More questions from patients:

Common antibiotics, like amoxicillin, won’t change the effectiveness of nexplanon. The antibiotic rifampin (also known as Rifadin and Rimactane) is the only exception — it can lower the effectiveness of nexplanon and other birth control methods. Rifampin is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.

Some other medicines can make nexplanon less effective. It’s important to let your nurse or doctor know about any drugs and medicines you take — prescription, over-the-counter, recreational, vitamins, and herbal supplements — before they prescribe anything new for you.
