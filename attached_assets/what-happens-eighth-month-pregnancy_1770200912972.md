During your 8th month of pregnancy, your fetus is about 11 inches long, and the lanugo (the fine, soft hair that covers your fetus’s body) begins to fall off.

## What happens during week 29 - 30?

* The fetus has a CRL of about 10.5 inches (27 cm).
* Testes usually begin descending into the scrotum from the abdomen between weeks 30 and 34 in a biologically male fetus. This is usually complete by 40 weeks.

## What happens during week 31 - 32?

* The fetus has a CRL of about 11 inches (28 cm).
* Lanugo starts falling off.

## What are the symptoms of pregnancy in the eighth month?

You may feel tired and have a more difficult time breathing as your uterus grows upward. You may get varicose veins — blue or red swollen veins most often in the legs — or hemorrhoids — varicose veins of the rectum. Hemorrhoids can be painful and itchy and can cause bleeding. You may also get stretch marks where your skin has expanded. Braxton-Hicks contractions, heartburn, and constipation may continue. You may urinate a bit when sneezing or laughing because of pressure from your uterus on your bladder. Hormones may make your hair appear fuller and healthier.
