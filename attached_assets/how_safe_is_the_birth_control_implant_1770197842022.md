### Want the implant?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## Can I get the birth control implant?

Most people can use the implant — also called Nexplanon — safely, but you shouldn’t use it if you’ve had breast cancer. Talk with your nurse or doctor about any other health conditions you have and you can decide together if the implant is a good fit for you.


## What are the risks of using the birth control implant?

Serious problems with Nexplanon are rare, but they include arm pain that lasts for longer than a few days, an infection in the arm that needs medicine, or a scar on your arm where the implant goes. Very rarely, the implant can bend or break in your arm. If that happens, it may not be working and needs to be taken out.

Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of the following while using Nexplanon:


- Bleeding, pus, discoloration, or pain in your arm where the implant was inserted that doesn’t go away

You can always call your doctor or your local Planned Parenthood health center if you have any concerns about your implant. They can help with any questions you may have.


## Is it safe to use the implant while breastfeeding?

Yes, it’s safe to use the implant while you’re breastfeeding.  It shouldn’t have any effect on how much milk you produce, and it won’t hurt your baby. In fact, the implant is a great method to use if you’re breastfeeding and you don’t want to get pregnant.
