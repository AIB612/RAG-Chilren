## What is the sponge?

The birth control sponge (aka the contraceptive sponge or “the sponge” for short), is a small, round sponge made from soft, squishy plastic. You put it deep inside your vagina before sex. The sponge covers your cervix and contains spermicide to help prevent pregnancy. Each sponge has a fabric loop attached to it to make it easier to take out.


## How does the sponge work?

The sponge prevents pregnancy two ways: It fits snugly against your cervix, blocking the entrance to your uterus so sperm can’t get to your egg. The sponge also contains spermicide, which slows sperm down so it can’t reach your egg.

The sponge can be used by itself, or with condoms. Using the sponge plus a condom gives you extra protection from pregnancy (bonus: condoms prevent the spread of STDs, too).
