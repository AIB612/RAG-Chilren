You shouldn't use the cervical cap during your period. It could increase your risk of infection. And don’t use a friend’s cervical cap or let a friend use yours.

Your nurse or doctor can help you decide if the cervical cap is safe for you.


## What are the risks of using a cervical cap?

Spermicide makes cervical caps a lot better at preventing pregnancy. But the chemical in most spermicides, nonoxynol-9, has some risks. If you use spermicide many times a day, it can irritate your vagina and increase your risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. If you’re worried about the spread of STDs, use condoms along with your cervical cap and spermicide to protect yourself.

Some people or their partners might feel pain or discomfort when using the cervical cap. If you notice that your vagina feels sore or irritated after you use your cervical cap, it could be that you're sensitive to the spermicide or the material that the cervical cap is made of. You can try a different brand of spermicide and see if that makes a difference. If the irritation feels really bad or if switching brands doesn't help, talk to your doctor.

You should also talk to your doctor if:


- your cervical cap feels uncomfortable

These things may mean that something is wrong. Most problems are easy to treat, so don’t worry — just talk to your doctor as soon as you can.
