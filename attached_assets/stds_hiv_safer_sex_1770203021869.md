## STDs

STDs are infections that are spread from one person to another, usually during vaginal, anal, and oral sex. They’re really common, and lots of people who have them don’t have any symptoms. Without treatment, STDs can lead to serious health problems. But the good news is that getting tested is no big deal, and most STDs are easy to treat.


## Make an Appointment for STD Testing

Getting tested for STDs is important: It’s the first step to feeling better if you’re having symptoms. And many STDs don’t have symptoms, so getting tested regularly will give you peace of mind. Enter your zip code to find a Planned Parenthood health center near you.
