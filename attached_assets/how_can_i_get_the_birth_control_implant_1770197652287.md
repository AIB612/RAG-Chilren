## How much does a birth control implant cost?

Getting your birth control implant — also called Nexplanon — can cost anywhere between $0 and $2,300. Implant removal can cost between $0 and $300. But the good news is that implants are totally free (or low cost) with most health insurance plans and some other government programs.

Even if the implant costs more than other methods up-front, it ends up saving you money in the long run because it lasts for 5 years.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can help you get birth control that fits your budget.

Planned Parenthood can also help you get health insurance — most insurance plans must cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost to you. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.


## Where can I get the birth control implant?

Nexplanon has to be put in your arm by a doctor or nurse who knows how to do it.  Call your gynecologist, a family planning center, or your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out more about getting the implant.


## Can I get the birth control implant for free or at low-cost?

There’s a good chance you can get the implant for free (or at a reduced price) if you have health insurance. Most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control, including the implant.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may be able to enroll in state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance, and many charge less for services and birth control depending on your income. Contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center for more information.
