What is an In-Clinic Abortion? How do they work?

You’ll go to a health center for counseling, an exam, and the abortion. The abortion itself usually takes 5-10 minutes, and you’ll get medicine to help with any pain.


### Thinking about getting an abortion?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## What do I need to do before my in-clinic abortion procedure?

Before your abortion, you’ll meet with your nurse, doctor, or health center counselor to talk about whether abortion is the right decision for you, and your abortion options. You’ll get an exam and lab tests, and maybe an ultrasound to figure out how far into your pregnancy you are.

Your nurse or doctor will let you know if there’s anything else you need to do to prepare for your abortion. They’ll give you written instructions on how to care for yourself after your abortion and how to take any medication they give you. You’ll also get a number you can call 24/7 if you have any questions or concerns.

Some bleeding and cramping is common after an abortion. So plan ahead to make your recovery time more comfortable. Give yourself the rest of the day to relax. Have maxi pads ready, and a heating pad for cramps in case you need it. Make sure you have some pain medication like ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) — but don’t take aspirin because it can make you bleed more.


## How do abortions work?

Before your abortion, you’ll get pain medicine to help with cramping. Some people might get medicine that either makes you relax or puts you to sleep completely. Your nurse or doctor will discuss your options with you. You’ll also get antibiotics to help prevent infection.

A nurse or doctor may need to open your cervix before the procedure. They may do this by giving you medicine, or by putting thin rods, called dilators, into the opening of your cervix a day or a few hours before your procedure.

A staff person will be in the procedure room the whole time. Their job is to support you and help the doctor or nurse during your abortion.

During an abortion procedure, the doctor or nurse will:


- examine your uterus

Once your abortion is over, you’ll hang out in a recovery area until you feel better and are ready to leave.

This type of abortion only takes about 5 to 10 minutes. But your appointment will take longer because you’ll need to have an exam, read and sign forms, and stay in the recovery room for up to about an hour after the abortion is done.

Thinking about birth control? You can get an implant, shot, or prescription for birth control while you’re there. Some doctors, abortion clinics, and Planned Parenthood health centers can put an IUD in your uterus right after your abortion, during the same procedure.


## What happens during a D&E (dilation and evacuation) procedure?

D&E is usually used for abortions later than 16 weeks after your last period.

Before a D&E abortion, your nurse or doctor will prepare your cervix. This means you may get medicine that helps open your cervix. Or your doctor might put thin rods, called dilators, into the opening of your cervix a day or a few hours before the procedure to help slowly stretch your cervix open.

For later second trimester abortions, you may also need a shot through your abdomen (belly) before the procedure starts.

Before your abortion, you’ll get pain medicine to  help with cramping. You may be able to get medicine that either makes you relax or puts you to sleep completely. You’ll also get antibiotics to help prevent infection.

A staff person will be in the procedure room the whole time. Their job is to support you and help the doctor or nurse during the abortion.

During a D&E abortion, the doctor or nurse will:

Once the procedure is done, you’ll hang out in a recovery area until you feel better and are ready to leave.

A D&E procedure usually takes between 10 and 20 minutes. But your appointment will take longer because you’ll need to have an exam, read and sign forms, get your cervix prepared, and stay in the recovery room for up to about an hour after the abortion is done.

If you’re interested in birth control, ask about getting an implant, IUD, shot, or prescription for another kind of birth control while you’re there.


## Does an abortion hurt?

Having an abortion feels different for everyone — it can be super painful or just a little uncomfortable. Your level of discomfort can depend on the medications you get, how far into your pregnancy you are, and how much cramping and pain you have. For most people, it feels like strong period cramps.

Your doctors and nurses will help make your abortion as comfortable as possible. You’ll get pain and numbing medications that will make it hurt less and you may get sedation.

You may have a little cramping after your abortion. You’ll probably want to take it easy for a while afterward, but most people feel back to normal the next day.
