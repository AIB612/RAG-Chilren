Internal condoms may take a bit of practice to get used to. And for them to work, you have to use them correctly every single time you have sex.


## You have to use one every time you have sex.

In order for internal condoms to work as well as possible, you have to use a new one every time you have vaginal or anal sex — and you have to use them correctly. Having a supply of condoms and keeping them nearby (like in your purse or next to your bed) makes it easier to use them.

If you’re not sure that you’ll be able to use internal condoms every single time you have sex, there are plenty of other types of birth control out there that are easier to use and offer better protection against pregnancy (like IUDs and implants).

Explore different birth control methods to see which may be best for you. But remember: whatever kind of birth control you’re on, adding either internal or male condoms every time you have sex is the best way to reduce your risk of STDs.


## Internal condoms take some getting used to.

Stopping to put on a condom may take you out of the moment. Or maybe you think the way internal condoms look hanging out of your vagina or anus kind of kills the mood.

If you feel this way, there are a few solutions you can try to make internal condoms work for you:


- Practice makes better: If you get used to internal condoms, you’ll be more comfortable and confident.

- Change your attitude: rather than getting annoyed about having to use a internal condom, focus on the sex part (and how awesome it is that condoms let you do it without stressing about pregnancy and STDs).

- Make internal condoms part of foreplay: keep the fire going by continuing to stimulate each other and being your fine, sexy selves while you or your partner insert the internal condom. You won’t feel like you’re stopping anything — it’s all part of the action.

- Some people may feel irritation on their vagina, vulva, penis or anus when they use the internal condom. It’s typically just caused by friction, so adding extra lubricant usually takes care of it. Even if you don’t have any discomfort, lube can really increase pleasure and sensation during sex — especially when using condoms.
