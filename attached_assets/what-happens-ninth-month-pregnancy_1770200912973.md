When you’re 9 months pregnant, your fetus’s eyes and pupils are more developed, and it has more body fat.

## What happens during week 33 - 34?

* The fetus has a CRL of about 12 inches (30 cm).
* The eyes have developed enough for pupils to constrict and dilate when exposed to light.
* Lanugo is nearly all gone.

## What happens during week 35 - 36?

* The fetus has a CRL of about 12.5 inches (32 cm).
* The fetus is considerably fatter, and the skin is no longer wrinkled.

## What are the symptoms of pregnancy in the ninth month?

The growing fetus places more and more strain on your body when you’re 9 months pregnant. Common pregnancy symptoms at this time may continue through the end of pregnancy. These symptoms include fatigue, trouble sleeping, trouble holding urine, shortness of breath, varicose veins, and stretch marks. Some fetuses drop down into the lower part of the uterus during this month. This may relieve your constipation and heartburn, which is more common earlier in pregnancy. But some fetuses don’t drop down until the very end of pregnancy.
