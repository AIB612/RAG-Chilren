Cervical caps come in different sizes, so your doctor will give you a prescription for the right size for you. You can get cervical caps at pharmacies and some health centers.


## Do I need a prescription for a cervical cap?

Yes. You need a prescription for a cervical cap from your nurse or doctor.  That’s because cervical caps are made in different sizes. So your nurse or doctor will need to examine you to figure out which size cervical cap is best for you.

Cervical caps aren't one size fits all — the FemCap cervical cap comes in three sizes:


- small: for people who’ve never been pregnant
- medium: for people who’ve had an abortion, miscarriage, or a cesarean
- large: for people who’ve given birth vaginally

## Where can I buy a cervical cap?

You can get a cervical cap at a pharmacy, drugstore, or health center after you get a prescription from your nurse or doctor.

You need to use spermicide with your cervical cap in order for it to work. You don’t need a prescription for spermicide. You can get spermicidal gels and creams over-the-counter at drugstores.


## How much do cervical caps cost?

Getting your cervical cap can cost anywhere from $0 to about $275 — that includes the cost of an exam, plus the cost of your cervical cap. Spermicide can cost around $5-15 a kit.

There's a good chance you can get a cervical cap for free (or at lower cost) if you have health insurance. Most insurance plans are required by law to cover birth control, including cervical caps.

If you don't have health insurance, you've still got options. You may qualify for state programs that can help you afford birth control and other health care services.

Planned Parenthood works to get you the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance, and some charge based on your income. Contact your local Planned Parenthood health center for more information.
