## How can I find out if I have PID?

The only way to know for sure if you have PID is to see a doctor. They’ll give you tests and talk to you about your symptoms and medical and sexual history. It’s important to be honest — PID can be mistaken for other infections, so doctors need all the facts to give you the right treatment before the infection gets worse. Don’t worry: they’re there to help, not judge.

Doctors can usually find out if you have PID by doing a pelvic exam. You may also be tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other infections, because they often cause PID. Your nurse or doctor may take samples of urine, blood, and/or fluids from your vagina and cervix.

In some cases, your doctor might need to do other tests or procedures. These can include an ultrasound; endometrial biopsy (taking a small sample of tissue from the lining of your uterus); and laparoscopy (inserting a tiny camera through a small cut in your belly button to look at your reproductive organs).


## Is there treatment for PID?

In most cases, antibiotics are used for pelvic inflammatory disease treatment. If you’re being treated for PID, make sure you:


- Take your medicine exactly the way the doctor tells you to. Finish ALL of your medicine, even if you feel better before it’s done.

- Take care of yourself!

	
		
		Rest in bed. You might need to stay in bed for several days if you have a serious infection.
		
		
		Drink lots of water, and eat healthy foods.
		
		
		Don’t douche or use tampons.
		
		
		If you’re in pain, you can take aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or naproxen (Aleve). A heating pad may also help.

- Don’t have sex until you finish all of your medicine and your doctor says your infection is totally gone. When you do have sex, using condoms every time will help prevent infections that could cause you to get PID again.

- Tell your sexual partner(s) that you have pelvic inflammatory disease. Anybody that you’ve had sex with recently should get tested and treated if needed, even if they feel fine. If your partner doesn’t get treated, you can get PID again.

If you’ve had PID for a long time or your infection is severe, it’s possible to develop health problems that require more treatment. You may need to have surgery to fix or remove parts of your reproductive organs.

Even though PID is curable, treatment might not be able to undo damage (like scarring or infertility) caused by chronic pelvic inflammatory disease. That’s why it’s so important to get treated as soon as possible.


## Where can I get tested or treated for PID?

You can get testing and treatment for PID at your family doctor or OB/GYN, many community health clinics, and your local Planned Parenthood health center.
