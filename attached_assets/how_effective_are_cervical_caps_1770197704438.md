It's really important to use your cervical cap correctly — every time you have sex. Here's how you can get maximum effectiveness from your cervical cap.


## How effective are cervical caps?

The cervical cap is a lot more effective if you've never given birth.

For people who’ve never given birth, the cervical cap is 86% effective — that means that out of 100 people who use the cap, about 14 of them will get pregnant within a year.

For people who have given birth, the cervical cap is 71% effective — that means that out of 100 people who use the cap, about 29 of them will get pregnant within a year.

Like all birth control methods, the cervical cap is most effective when you use it correctly every time you have sex. If you don’t always follow the directions or use your cervical cap every single time you have sex, it won’t work as well.

Want an even more effective form of birth control? Check out IUDs and implants. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control.

## Does a cervical cap protect me from STDs?

Cervical caps don’t protect against sexually transmitted infections — but luckily, condoms do. If you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex, using condoms every time (plus getting tested for STDs regularly) are the best ways to stay healthy.
