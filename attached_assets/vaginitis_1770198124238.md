## What causes vaginitis?

Vaginitis is when your vulva or vagina becomes inflamed or irritated. This can happen when there’s a change in the normal chemical balance of your vagina, or if you have a reaction to irritating products.

Many things can cause vaginitis — and sometimes there’s more than 1 cause. Things that lead to vaginitis include:


- Common vaginal infections like:

	
		
		vaginal yeast infections
		
		
		bacterial vaginosis
		
		
		trichomoniasis

- Lack of Estrogen (atrophic vaginitis):
	Lack of estrogen can lead to a type of vaginitis called atrophic vaginitis (also known as vaginal atrophy). Atrophic vaginitis is when you have irritation but no abnormal discharge. Things that can cause low estrogen include:

	
		
		Breastfeeding
		
		
		Menopause
		
		
		Damage to your ovaries, or having your ovaries removed

- Vaginal Sex
	Vaginitis isn’t a sexually transmitted infection. But sometimes sexual activity can lead to vaginitis. Your partner’s natural genital chemistry can change the balance of yeast and bacteria in your vagina. In rare cases, you can have an allergic reaction to your partner’s semen. Friction from sex, or certain types of lubricants, condoms, and sex toys may also cause irritation. Read more about vaginitis and sex.

- Recurrent Vaginitis
	Some people get vaginitis a lot. If you have vaginitis 4 or more times in a year, it’s called recurrent vaginitis. You can get recurrent vaginitis if you have conditions like diabetes or HIV that make your immune system weak. You can also get recurrent vaginitis if you don't finish your vaginitis treatment.

- Vaginal discharge that isn’t normal for you:

	
		
		With yeast infections, discharge is usually thick, white, and odorless. You may also have a white coating in and around your vagina.
		
		
		With bacterial vaginosis, you may have vaginal discharge that’s grayish, foamy, and smells fishy. (But it’s also common for BV to have no symptoms.)
		
		
		With trich, discharge is often frothy, yellow-green, smells bad, and may have spots of blood in it.

Vaginitis symptoms can be super obvious, or barely noticeable. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all. It's a good idea to pay attention to what your vulva and vaginal discharge normally looks, feels, and smells like, so it’s easier to notice any changes that could be signs of vaginitis or other infections.
