### Want an IUD?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How effective are IUDs when used as birth control?

IUDs are one of the best birth control methods out there — more than 99% effective. That means fewer than 1 out of 100 people who use an IUD will get pregnant each year.

IUDs are so effective because there's no chance of making a mistake. You can’t forget to take it (like the pill), or use it incorrectly (like condoms). And you're protected from pregnancy 24/7 for 3 to 12 years, depending on which kind you get. Once your IUD is in place, you can pretty much forget about it until it expires. You can keep track of your insertion and removal date using our birth control app.


## How effective are IUDs when used as emergency contraception?

The Paragard (copper), Mirena, and Liletta IUDs are the most effective method of emergency contraception available. If you get one of these IUDs put in within 120 hours (5 days) after having unprotected sex, it’s more than 99.9% effective at preventing pregnancy. Then, if you want to, you can keep it and have really effective birth control that you can use for up to 8 to 12 years (depending on which kind you get).


## Do IUDs protect against STDs?

No, IUDs don't protect against STDs. Luckily, using condoms or internal condoms every time you have sex does lower the chance of getting or spreading STDs. So using condoms with your IUD is the way to go.
