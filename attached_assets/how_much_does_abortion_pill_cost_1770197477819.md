## How do I get help paying for my abortion?

You may be able to have some or all of the cost of your abortion covered by your health insurance, depending on your plan and where you get your abortion. Call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out if your insurance can help lower the cost of your abortion. Our staff can also let you know if there is financial assistance available for your abortion and other related costs, like transportation.

Some government health insurance plans in certain states cover abortion, while others don’t. Some plans only cover abortion in certain cases.

Abortion funds may also be able to help you pay for your abortion. Abortion funds may also offer help with transportation, lodging, childcare, and other resources you may need to access abortion. The National Network of Abortion Funds connects people with organizations that can provide financial and logistical support for people getting abortions in the U.S. Just keep in mind that you need to already have an appointment scheduled in order to search for funding.

If you’re worried about cost, call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to learn about options for getting health care that you can afford.
