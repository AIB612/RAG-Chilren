### Thinking about sterilization?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How much does tubal ligation cost?

Tubal ligation can cost between $0 to $6,000, including follow-up visits.

The cost of a tubal ligation varies and depends on where you get it, what kind you get, and whether or not you have health insurance that will cover some or all of the cost. Tubal ligation may be totally free (or low cost) with some health insurance plans and other government programs.

Even if tubal ligation costs more than other methods up front, it usually ends up saving you money in the long run because it lasts forever. Vasectomies (aka male sterilization) are usually a lot cheaper than female sterilization.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.


## Can I get free tubal ligation?

There’s a good chance you can get a tubal ligation for free (or at a reduced price) if you have health insurance. Most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control with no cost to you, including some female sterilization procedures. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may be able to enroll in state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance, and many charge less for services depending on your income. Contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center for more information.


## Where can I get a tubal ligation?

You can get a tubal ligation at a doctor’s office, hospital, or health clinic. Many Planned Parenthood health centers also do some types of sterilization procedures. If your nearest Planned Parenthood doesn’t do tubal ligation, they may be able to refer you to other health care providers in your area who do.

Some choose to get sterilized right after giving birth or having an abortion. Talk with your doctor ahead of time if you want to combine sterilization with another procedure.

Depending on where you live, there may be age restrictions or waiting periods to get a tubal ligation. You can ask about these when you call to make an appointment.
