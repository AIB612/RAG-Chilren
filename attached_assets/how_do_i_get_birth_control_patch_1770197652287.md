### Want the patch?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How much does the birth control patch cost?

Prices vary depending on whether you have private health insurance, or if you qualify for government programs that cover the cost of the patch.

One pack has 3 patches and lasts for 1 month (or 3 weeks, if you choose to use the patch to skip your period). One pack of patches can cost anywhere from $0-$150. But the patch is totally free with most health insurance plans, or if you qualify for some government programs that pay for birth control.

You may also need to pay for an appointment with a doctor or nurse to get a prescription for the patch. This visit can cost anywhere from $35–$250. But most insurance plans cover doctor’s visits that are related to birth control. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.


## How can I get the patch for free?

There’s a good chance you can get low-cost or free birth control patches if you have health insurance. Most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control with little or no cost to you, including the patch. Your health insurance provider can tell you how much it will cost, and your nurse or doctor may also be able to help you get your birth control covered. Learn more about health insurance and affordable birth control.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and documentation status in the U.S., you could qualify for government programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance. And many charge less depending on your income. Contact your local Planned Parenthood health center for more information.


## Where can I get the birth control patch?

You need a prescription for the birth control patch. You can get a prescription from a doctor or nurse at a doctor’s office, health clinic, or your local Planned Parenthood health center.  In some places, you can get a prescription through the Planned Parenthood Direct app or directly from a pharmacist.

During your visit, a nurse or doctor will talk with you about your medical history, check your blood pressure, and give you whatever exams you may need. Most people don’t need a pelvic exam in order to get the patch. Your nurse or doctor will help you decide what’s right for you based on your health history.

You may be able to get your birth control patches right away during your appointment. Or you’ll get a prescription from the nurse or doctor, and you’ll go pick up your patches at a drugstore or pharmacy.


## More questions from patients:

You can get a new prescription for the birth control patch by making a telehealth appointment at your local Planned Parenthood health center. Telehealth visits are done by video by the same compassionate nurses and doctors who work at our health centers. Be prepared to share information about your health, birth control needs, and insurance.

Depending on what state you live in, you may also be able to download and use the Planned Parenthood Direct app for new prescriptions and refills on the birth control patch. Learn more here.
