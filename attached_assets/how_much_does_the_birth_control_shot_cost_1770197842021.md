## How much does Depo-Provera cost?

How much the birth control shot costs depends on a couple of different things, like where you live, if you have health insurance, or if you qualify for any programs in your area that help pay for the shot. In most cases, you’ll need an exam when you get your first shot, which may have an additional cost.  If you need an exam, it may cost between $0-$250. Each visit after the first one may cost between $0 and $150.

The good news is that most insurance plans must cover doctors’ visits related to birth control. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.
