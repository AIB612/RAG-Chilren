## Where can I buy internal condoms?

Internal condoms can sometimes be a little harder to find than traditional condoms. The only brand of internal condom that’s FDA approved and available in the U.S. is the FC2 Female Condom®. It’s available online at the FC2 Female Condom® website, at many Planned Parenthood health centers, family planning and health clinics, and by prescription in drugstores.


## How much do internal condoms cost?

Internal condoms cost $2 - $3 each if your insurance doesn't cover the cost. They are often sold in packs of 12.

Some family planning clinics and local health centers may provide internal condoms for free. Contact your local Planned Parenthood health center for help.

No matter how much internal condoms cost, the pregnancy and STD protection you get from them is totally worth it — your health is priceless.


## More questions from patients:

The term “female condom” is no longer used because people of any gender can use internal condoms. You can put an internal condom inside the vagina to help prevent pregnancy and STDs, or inside the anus to help prevent STDs.

Internal condoms are harder to find because there’s only one brand that’s FDA approved and available in the U.S.. You can get a prescription for the internal condom, or you can find them  online at the FC2 Internal Condom® website. You can also get internal condoms at many Planned Parenthood health centers or family planning and health clinics.
