- What treatments are there for menopause symptoms?
The treatment that works best is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Since your body stops making some hormones during perimenopause and menopause, taking them as medicine can help with symptoms.

You don’t have to get treatment just because you’re going through menopause. But if you have symptoms like hot flashes, problems sleeping, and mood changes that are getting in the way of your daily life, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) may help. If you want to treat vaginal dryness only, topical treatments (like gels and creams) that you put on your skin or in your vagina (like tablets) work well. You can talk to a nurse or doctor at your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to see which treatments are right for you.


## What is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)?

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) works by replacing 2 hormones that your ovaries stop making when you’re going through perimenopause and menopause: estrogen and progesterone. They’re like the hormones in some birth control methods.

There are two different kinds of hormone therapy: estrogen only (estrogen therapy), or estrogen with a progestogen (combined hormone therapy).

Estrogen therapy:

This is the best treatment for hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. People who have had surgery to remove their uterus, called a hysterectomy, only need to take estrogen therapy and don’t need to take combined hormone therapy.

Combined hormone therapy:

If you have a uterus, your doctor may prescribe combined hormone therapy. This is estrogen and artificial progesterone (called progestogen) taken together. Combined hormone therapy may lower your risk of getting uterine cancer and colon cancer.

Both hormone therapies can help with:


- hot flashes
- vaginal dryness
- sleep problems
- urinary tract infections
- sudden urges to pee
- lowering your risk of osteoporosis, colon cancer, and diabetes
- lowering your risk of heart disease if you start MHT within 10 years of menopause

## How do you take MHT?

Some of the options for how to take hormone therapy are like the options for taking hormonal birth control. These options are:


- pills
- patches
- rings
- vaginal creams (best for people who only have vaginal dryness as a symptom)

## What are the side effects of MHT?

Side effects of MHT, if you have them, vary based on what kind of hormone(s) you’re taking. Side effects usually don’t last long or need to be treated. They may include:


- bloating
- swelling  in your arms and legs
- tender breasts
- headaches
- nausea
- irregular vaginal bleeding
- mood swings
- weight gain

## What are the risks of MHT?

Hormone therapy can have some risks, depending on your personal medical history and your family’s medical history.

MHT may increase your risk for:


- blood clots: if you take MHT by mouth
- breast cancer: if you take MHT for more than 5 years or if you take combined MHT (estrogen and progestogen)
- heart disease: if you start MHT after age 60 or more than 10 years after menopause
- cancer in your uterus: if you take estrogen-only MHT;
- cancer in your ovaries
- gallbladder disease and gallstones
If you have a uterus, you may take MHT with one or both hormones (estrogen and progestogen). If you’ve had a hysterectomy (a surgery that removes your uterus) you only need to take one hormone: estrogen. Hormones that you swallow in pill form increase some of these risks.

If you’re thinking about taking hormone therapy, you can talk with the staff at your nearest Planned Parenthood health center. They can help you decide if the benefits are worth the risks.


## Are there other treatment options for menopause symptoms?

People sometimes choose other methods of treating menopause symptoms if they’re worried about the risks of hormone therapy.

Some other methods are:


- homeopathy
- herbal treatments
- Acupuncture
While these methods are valued by many people and cultures, it’s important to be aware that they can also have side effects like hormone therapy. More research on these methods is also needed to fully understand their benefits and effectiveness. So if you want to go in that direction, consult someone who’s skilled and experienced in treating menopause. They can help you decide if their method is right for you and help you do it safely. And if you do choose one of these methods to treat your symptoms, be sure to let your nurse or doctor know.


## What if I don’t want MHT treatment?

You may choose not to take MHT. Depending on your symptoms, changes to your lifestyle or other medicines may help. If you need birth control and have hot flashes, combined hormonal birth control — like the pill, patch, or ring — may be the best choice as long as you don't smoke or have certain health problems.

You can contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to talk about any of these options and get help with deciding what to do.


## Where can I get treatment or more information?

Contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health centers for help going through perimenopause and menopause.

You can also contact the North American Menopause Society.


## More questions from patients:

Hot flashes are a common and difficult symptom of menopause and perimenopause. Nothing makes them stop completely, but some natural remedies for hot flashes may help. You can try:


- regular exercise
- avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and smoking
- meditation or other relaxation techniques
- cooling down the temperature of your living space — especially your bedroom
- wearing thin layers of clothes so you can take layers off during hot flashes
- using bed sheets that are made of natural fibers, which are breathable, such as cotton, linen, or bamboo
- keeping a record of when you have hot flashes to help you figure out if anything is triggering them
Some people us plant and herbal supplements to help with hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. These can include soy, red clover, black cohosh, and certain other herbs. But more research on these  herbal remedies needs to be done to fully understand their benefits and effectiveness in treating menopause symptoms.

If you do choose to take herbal supplements, you can also talk with your nurse or doctor. They can help you decide if supplements can support your current symptoms, treatment, as well as discuss any side effects or risks.

Your staff at your nearest Planned Parenthood health center can help you find the best way to treat  your hot flashes.
