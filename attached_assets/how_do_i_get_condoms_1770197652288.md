Condoms are sold in lots of different stores, and you can even get them for free from many health centers. Boxes of 3 cost about $2 to $6. Condoms usually cost less than $1 each if you buy packs of 12 or more.


## Where can I get condoms?

One of the best things about condoms is that they’re sold pretty much everywhere, which makes them super convenient and easy to get.

You can get condoms from drugstores, Planned Parenthood health centers, community health centers, doctor’s offices, supermarkets, convenience stores, online, and even from vending machines. You don’t need a prescription and there are no age restrictions — anybody can buy condoms.

Some people feel kind of awkward going into a store and buying condoms, but your health is more important than a little embarrassment. Besides, buying condoms shouldn’t be embarrassing in the first place — it means you’re being responsible, and protecting yourself and your partner.

If you feel like you absolutely can’t go into a store and buy condoms for yourself, ask someone you trust for help. You can also visit a Planned Parenthood health center or other community health center for condoms and advice about birth control and STDs.


## How much do condoms cost?

You don’t have to spend a ton of money to protect yourself from pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are usually inexpensive, and can even be free.

On average, condoms cost about a dollar each, but it may be less or more depending on the brand, store, and package — most of the time larger packs end up being a better value. Boxes of 3 go for about $2 to $6. In packages of 12 or more, condoms usually cost less than $1 each. So stocking up on condoms not only helps you be prepared, it can also save money.

Affordable or free condoms are often available at Planned Parenthood health centers, family planning clinics, your local health department, community centers, college health centers, or your doctor’s office.

Your health is priceless — no matter how much condoms cost, the pregnancy and STD protection they give you is totally worth it. If you’re worried about how to pay for condoms, your local Planned Parenthood health center can help you get condoms and other birth control methods for free or low cost.


## What are the best condoms to get?

Most condoms are made from latex, a type of rubber. There are also condoms made out of soft plastics like polyurethane, polyisoprene, and nitrile if you’re allergic to latex.

Lambskin and other animal membrane condoms only prevent pregnancy — they don’t protect you from HIV or other STDs.

When it comes to effectiveness, using condoms correctly every time you have sex is more important than buying a certain brand. All latex and plastic condoms provide similar protection against pregnancy and STDs. Whether they’re flavored, ribbed or studded, or regular ol’ condoms, just check the box or wrapper to make sure it says that the condom protects against STDs and pregnancy.

Condoms come in different sizes, textures, shapes, and even flavors (for oral sex). You can try different types of condoms to find the one that you like best. Condoms are very stretchy and versatile, so most people will fit into a basic condom comfortably. If you find that standard condoms feel too tight, buy a larger size. If condoms tend to slip around a lot or fall off during sex, try a smaller size.

Condoms last a long time, but they break down with age and when they’re not stored properly. No matter where you get your condoms, check them out before use. Make sure the wrapper doesn’t have holes or leaks and the expiration date hasn’t passed.


## More questions from patients:

Condoms come in all different sizes. Finding the right size is important for safer sex. Condoms that are too tight may break and condoms that are too big could slip off or cause semen to leak. All of these increase your risk of STDs or unintended pregnancy.

The best way to figure out what size condom you need is to try different ones. Start with a regular condom. Does it roll on easily and stay in place? It’s the right size. If it feels loose or seems to slip off, go for a smaller size. (They’re labeled “small” or “snug.”) And if it’s painfully tight or looks like it’ll tear, try a bigger size. Start with “large” or magnum” condoms. If those are still too tight, try “extra large” or “XL.”

Anyone can buy condoms. You don’t have to be a certain age, show an ID, or have a prescription.

You can buy condoms lots of places, like your local drugstore, supermarket, convenience store, or online. You can also sometimes get them for free at family planning centers, like your nearest Planned Parenthood health center.
