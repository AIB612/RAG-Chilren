If you miss a period, you might be pregnant. But it’s also normal to have missed or light periods when you use hormonal birth control and not be pregnant. If you made a mistake with Twirla and miss 1 period, or you miss 2 periods in a row, take a pregnancy test just to be sure.

Call a nurse or doctor — like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center — if you think you might be pregnant or you have any other questions about your birth control patch. You can also talk with a live health educator at our free chat/text line.
