### Thinking about getting the abortion pill?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.

A person holds a glass of water and raises a pill to their mouth as they prepare to take medicine.


## Where can I get the abortion pill?

You can get medication abortion (AKA abortion pills) from many Planned Parenthood health centers. Our caring doctors and nurses are experts at providing safe abortion and non-judgmental support throughout the process. You can also get abortion pills from some private doctors or gynecologists, family planning clinics, and abortion clinics. Even if your nearest Planned Parenthood health center doesn't provide abortion pills, you can call for more information about where to get them. You can also visit AbortionFinder.org.

Depending on where you live, there may be restrictions if you’re 17 years old or younger, or waiting periods to get an abortion. You can ask about these when you call your doctor or your nearest Planned Parenthood health center.

Some states have banned abortion or created lots of restrictions, which means it can be hard or illegal to get the abortion pill in those states. But abortion is still legal in many states, and it’s legal to travel to another state to get an abortion. You can learn more about the laws in your state at AbortionFinder.org.

When you’re looking for a place to get an abortion, beware of “crisis pregnancy centers.” These are places that seem like normal medical centers, but they don't provide abortion or a full range of health care — they're actually run by people who want to scare or shame people out of getting an abortion. They often give you false or misleading information about pregnancy, abortion, and birth control, and they usually don't have to follow privacy laws. Your nearest Planned Parenthood health center or AbortionFinder.org can help you find a trustworthy abortion provider in your area.


## Getting the abortion pill in the mail

In some states, you can do a virtual (telehealth) visit and have the pills mailed to you or pick them up at your local pharmacy.

At this time, only some Planned Parenthood health centers are able to offer telehealth for the abortion pill. The best way to learn about the services available in your area is to call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center.

If you have questions about the abortion pill and want to talk to someone, you can chat live with the educators at Aya Contigo.  Get emotional support and information when you need it. It's free and confidential (only available in the United States).


## What’s a self-managed abortion?

Finding and taking abortion pills to end a pregnancy without the help of a doctor or nurse is called “self-managed abortion” (which some people call an “at-home abortion”). Research shows that self-managing an abortion with abortion pills (mifepristone and/or misoprostol) can be safe and effective. This is especially true for people who:


- Usually have regular periods, are fairly sure of the first day of their last period, and are less than 11 weeks from the first day of their last period
- Have access to good information about how to take the pills
- Don’t have medical reasons why they shouldn’t use the pills (like inherited bleeding disorders, heart or kidney disease, still have an IUD in place, or think you have an ectopic pregnancy)
- Could get to urgent care, if needed
As it gets harder for so many people to access abortion due to state laws, more and more people may choose self-managed abortion for lots of different reasons, like because they can’t afford to travel for care.

Plan C has more information about the difference between getting an abortion from a doctor or nurse, like the staff at your nearestPlanned Parenthood, and a self-managed abortion.

But, there may be legal risks to buying and using abortion pills outside of the health care system. Repro Legal Helpline has more information about this.

After taking abortion pills, it’s normal to have fever, chills, nausea, strong cramping and heavy bleeding for a day. If you’ve used abortion pills and have symptoms that worry you, like soaking more than 2 maxi pads an hour for more than 2 hours in a row, heavy bleeding for several days that causes dizziness, chills, and/or fever lasting more than 24 hours, go to an emergency room. Emergency doctors and nurses can care for you whether or not they know about a self-managed abortion. In fact, the symptoms after taking abortion pills are the same as a miscarriage. That information should make no difference in your treatment.

Remember that if you have any concerns about your health, including any symptoms you’re experiencing during or after an abortion, your nearest Planned Parenthood is available to help you, even if we didn’t provide your abortion. We can also help you get set up with birth control after an abortion.

If you can't get in touch with a Planned Parenthood health center, but still have questions about a miscarriage or abortion, the Miscarriage + Abortion Hotline is a private and secure phone and text hotline, staffed by medical professionals. They are not affiliated with Planned Parenthood, but they may be able to provide helpful information.
