## How much does a vasectomy cost?

Getting a vasectomy can cost anywhere between $0 and $1,000, including follow-up visits.

The cost of a vasectomy varies and depends on where you get it, what kind you get, and whether or not you have health insurance that will cover some or all of the cost. Vasectomies may be totally free (or low cost) with some health insurance plans, and government programs.

Even if your vasectomy costs more than other methods up front, it usually ends up saving you money in the long run, because it lasts forever. Vasectomies are about 6 times cheaper than female sterilization.


## Can I get a vasectomy for free or at a low cost?

Most insurance plans must cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost to you. This policy does NOT include vasectomies, but many insurance plans cover some or all of the cost of vasectomies anyway.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may be able to sign up for government programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance, and many charge less for services depending on your income. Other clinics and doctors that provide vasectomies may also use a sliding scale based on your income.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with a vasectomy within your budget. Planned Parenthood can also help you get health insurance.


## Where can I get a vasectomy?

You can get a vasectomy at many Planned Parenthood health centers, a doctor’s office, hospital, or health clinic.
