## How much does an STD test cost?

How much you pay for STD testing depends on where you go, what tests you need, your income, and whether or not you use health insurance. It costs anywhere from $0-250, depending on which STDs you’re getting tested for, and whether or not you have symptoms or need an exam.

You can probably get STD testing for free or at a reduced price if you have health insurance. STD testing can also be free or low cost with government programs. And some health centers — including many Planned Parenthood health centers — give free or low-cost STD tests, depending on your income.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have health insurance. If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center, local health department, or other community health center to see if they can hook you up with STD testing that fits your budget.
