- COVID-19 and Your Sexual Health
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19 / COVID) isn’t an STD. But you can get it if you have close physical contact with someone who has COVID-19. Luckily, the COVID-19 vaccine can help protect you and your partners from getting really sick, going to the hospital, getting long covid, or dying from COVID-19. Getting the vaccine can also help lower your chances of spreading it to others. In addition, wearing good masks, like KN95s or N95s, especially when you’re in public spaces, near someone sick, or are feeling sick yourself is another great way to keep you and others safe.


## Can you get COVID-19 from sex?

Yes. You can get COVID-19, especially if you’re within 6 feet of someone who has it and in a place with poor ventilation. COVID-19 spreads through tiny droplets (aerosols) that travel in the air when someone coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. You can also get it from direct contact with saliva (spit) or mucus, such as kissing. So activities that involve being physically close to someone can easily spread COVID-19.

Some people with COVID-19 might not have symptoms, or their symptoms may be mild. So you can’t know for sure if someone has COVID-19 based on how they look or feel. The best way to know if someone has COVID-19 is to test.


## How can I safely have sex without getting COVID-19?

The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to get vaccine boosters, and test regularly. Just like with STDs, COVID-19 does not always have symptoms, so the only way to know is to test if you think you’ve been in contact with someone with COVID-19.

There are a few situations where you may need to take extra precautions to protect yourself from COVID-19 — like avoiding close, physical contact and wearing masks more often — even if you’re vaccinated:


- You’re at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
- Someone in your household is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, or they’re unvaccinated.
- Your partner(s) are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, or they’re unvaccinated.
If you or your partner are feeling sick or think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, get tested. You can buy a test at many drug stores, get tested at a local health clinic, or make an appointment with your nurse or doctor. If you test positive, you may have to quarantine or isolate, depending on the situation.

How soon you can have sex after a positive COVID-19 test depends on how soon you test negative and whether you still have symptoms. Talk to your nurse or doctor or follow CDC guidelines.

The safest person to have sex with is yourself: masturbation doesn’t spread COVID-19, or any other infections. Just make sure to wash your hands and sex toys with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after.

The safest sexual partners are people who already live with you, or people who are fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19.

Remember, you still need to ask for consent every time you want to have any kind of sex. Even if you’ve had sex before, and even if you’re in a relationship, live together, or are married. If your partner doesn’t want to have sex for any reason — including being worried about COVID-19 — respect that.
