Prenatal tests are different procedures that make sure you and the fetus are healthy. Some prenatal tests find birth defects and other problems.

## Why do people get prenatal tests?

Your doctor, nurse, or midwife may suggest prenatal testing at certain times during your pregnancy, to make sure you’re healthy and that your fetus is developing normally. Some prenatal tests can also find possible birth defects.

Your doctor might recommend specific tests, depending on your age and other risk factors. Some people have a higher risk for problems and birth defects than others. Your doctor will let you know which tests may be right for you.
