## What are the symptoms of pregnancy in the sixth month?

Pregnancy symptoms from the fourth and fifth month usually continue. Shortness of breath may improve. Your breasts may start producing colostrum — tiny drops of early milk. This may continue throughout the rest of your pregnancy.

Some people have Braxton-Hicks contractions when they’re 6 months pregnant. They feel like a painless squeezing of the uterus or abdomen. This is the uterus’s way of practicing for giving birth. Braxton-Hicks contractions are normal and not a sign of early labor. But check with your doctor if you have painful or frequent contractions or if you have any concerns.
