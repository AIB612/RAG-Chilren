## Where can I get an in-clinic abortion?

You can get an in-clinic abortion at many Planned Parenthood health centers. Our caring doctors and nurses are experts at providing safe abortion and providing support throughout the process. You can also get an abortion from some private doctors or gynecologists, family planning clinics, and abortion clinics. Even if your local Planned Parenthood health center doesn't provide abortion services, you can call for more information about where to get an abortion. You can also visit AbortionFinder.org.

Depending on where you live, there may be restrictions if you’re 17 years old or younger, or waiting periods to get an abortion. You can ask about these when you call to make your appointment. All abortions are very safe, but it may be harder to find a health care provider who will do an abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy, so it’s best to try to have your abortion as soon as possible.

Some states have banned abortion or created lots of restrictions, which means it’s hard or illegal to get care in those states. But abortion is still legal in many states, and it’s legal to travel to another state to get an abortion. You can learn more about the laws in your state at AbortionFinder.org.

When you’re looking for a place to get an abortion, beware of “crisis pregnancy centers.” These are places that seem like normal medical centers, but they don't provide abortion or a full range of health care — they're actually run by people who want to scare or shame people out of getting an abortion. They often give you false or misleading information about pregnancy, abortion, and birth control, and they usually don't have to follow privacy laws. Your local Planned Parenthood health center or AbortionFinder.org can help you find a trustworthy abortion provider in your area.


## How much does an abortion cost?

An in-clinic abortion can cost up to around $800 in the first trimester, but it’s often less. The average cost of a first trimester in-clinic abortion at Planned Parenthood is about $600. The cost of a second trimester abortion at Planned Parenthood varies depending on how many weeks pregnant you are. The average ranges from about $715 earlier in the second trimester to $1,500-2,000 later in the second trimester.

The cost of abortion can vary depending on the state or health center where you get care and whether you can use health insurance (private or government insurance). Your nearest Planned Parenthood health center can give you more information about the cost and funds that might be available to help you pay for your abortion.

Some things to know:


- The professionals at Planned Parenthood will work to get you the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Contact your nearest health center for more information on costs and whether financial and logistical assistance may be available.
- Your abortion may be free or low-cost with health insurance. Some insurance plans don’t cover abortions. You can call your insurance provider directly to find out their policies.
- Some government health insurance plans (like Medicaid) in certain states cover abortion, while others don’t. Some plans only cover abortion in certain cases.

## How do I get help paying for my abortion?

You may be able to have some or all of the cost of your abortion covered by your health insurance, depending on your plan and where you get your abortion. Call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out if your insurance can help lower the cost of your abortion. Our staff can also let you know if there is financial assistance available for your abortion and other related costs, like transportation.

Some government health insurance plans in certain states cover abortion, while others don’t. Some plans only cover abortion in certain cases.

Abortion funds may also be able to help you pay for your abortion. Abortion funds may also offer help with transportation, lodging, childcare, and other resources you may need to access abortion. The National Network of Abortion Funds connects people with organizations that can provide financial and logistical support for people getting abortions in the U.S. Just keep in mind that you need to already have an appointment scheduled in order to search for funding.

If you’re worried about cost, call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to learn about options for getting health care that you can afford.
