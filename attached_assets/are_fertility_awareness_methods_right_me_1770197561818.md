- Are fertility awareness methods right for me?
FAMs are safe, inexpensive, and hormone-free. But they can be inconvenient and hard to use correctly, so they’re less effective than other types of birth control.


### Want to learn how to track your fertility?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How safe are fertility awareness methods?

Fertility awareness methods are totally safe. Because you’re not taking any medicine, they’re completely safe and have no side effects.


## How effective are fertility awareness methods?

FAMs are about 77-98% effective: that means 2-23 out of 100 couples who use FAMs will get pregnant each year, depending on which method(s) are used. If you use multiple FAMs together, they work even better.

FAMs don’t work as well for people who can’t track their fertility signs daily, or don’t want to avoid unprotected sex on fertile days. They’re also not good methods for people with irregular menstrual cycles. It’s best to have a nurse, doctor, or counselor who understands FAMs give you instructions and help you use them correctly.

## Do fertility awareness methods have any side effects?

There’s no risk of side effects with FAMs. But certain things can change how effective these methods are for you, like if you’ve recently been sick, used the morning-after pill, been pregnant, or are breastfeeding.


## Can anyone use these methods?

FAMs are safe for everyone, but they only work to prevent pregnancy for certain people.

FAMs won’t work for you if:

## What are the advantages of fertility awareness methods?

The benefits of fertility awareness methods are that they’re usually free or cheap, have no side effects, and help you learn about your body and your fertility.


## Do fertility awareness methods protect against STDs?

Nope. Fertility awareness methods do not prevent sexually transmitted infections. Condoms are the best way to protect yourselves from STDs, and they give you extra protection from pregnancy, too.
