## How much does the birth control ring cost?

Prices vary depending on whether you have health insurance, or if you qualify for government programs that cover the cost of the birth control ring.

One NuvaRing lasts for up to 5 weeks, and can cost anywhere from $0-$200. One Annovera ring lasts for 1 year and can cost anywhere from $0-2200. That’s a pretty wide range, but the good news is birth control rings are totally free with most health insurance plans or if you qualify for some government programs. You may also be able to get the birth control ring at low-cost from your local Planned Parenthood health center.

You may also need to pay for an appointment with a doctor or nurse to get a prescription for the ring. This visit can cost anywhere from $35–$250. But most insurance plans cover doctor’s visits that are related to birth control. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.


## How can I get the birth control ring for free?

There’s a good chance you can get low-cost or free birth control rings if you have health insurance. Most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control with little or no cost to you, including the ring. Your health insurance provider can tell you how much it will cost, and your doctor may also be able to help you get your birth control covered by health insurance. Learn more about health insurance and affordable birth control.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and documentation status in the U.S., you could qualify for government programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance. And many charge less depending on your income. Contact your local Planned Parenthood health center for more information.


## Where can I get the ring?

You need a prescription for the birth control ring. You can get a prescription from a doctor or nurse at a doctor’s office, health clinic, or your local Planned Parenthood health center. In a few states, you can even get a prescription through the Planned Parenthood Direct app or directly from a pharmacist.

During your visit, a nurse or doctor will talk with you about your medical history, check your blood pressure, and give you whatever exams you may need. Most people don’t need pelvic exams in order to get the birth control ring. Your nurse or doctor will help you decide what’s right for you based on your medical history.

You may be able to get your birth control ring right away during your appointment. Or you’ll get a prescription from the nurse or doctor, and you’ll go pick up your ring at a drugstore or pharmacy.
