# Sexual Orientation

Sexual orientation is about who you’re attracted to and want to have relationships with. Only you can decide what sexual identity best describes you.


### How do I know my sexual orientation?

Not everyone knows their sexual orientation or how to label themselves. If you feel this way, know that it’s common and you’re not alone.


### Coming Out

Not everyone comes out in the same way. And not everyone comes out to everybody in their lives. There’s no one right way to come out.
