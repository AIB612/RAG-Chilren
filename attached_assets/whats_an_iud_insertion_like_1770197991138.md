A doctor or nurse puts the IUD in through your vagina and into your uterus. Some people feel cramps or pain, but it doesn't last long and medicine can help.


### Want an IUD?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How is an IUD put in?

First, your nurse or doctor will ask you some questions about your medical history. Then they’ll check your vagina, cervix, and uterus, and they may test you for STDs. You may be offered medicine to help open and/or numb your cervix before the IUD is put in.

To put the IUD in, the nurse or doctor will put a speculum into your vagina and then use a special inserter to put the IUD in through the opening of your cervix and into your uterus. The process usually takes less than five minutes.

IUDs can be put in at any point in your menstrual cycle, and you can usually get one put in right after giving birth or having an abortion.


## How does it feel to get an IUD put in?

People usually feel some cramping or pain when they're getting their IUD placed. The pain can be worse for some than for others. The pain during IUD placement may be more intense if you have never experienced childbirth or if you have previous experiences of trauma, depression, or anxiety. IUDs can be placed with or without medicines to help with the pain, and there are a few different types of medicines that can be used.

Some doctors or nurses tell you to take pain medicine before you get the IUD to help reduce pain from cramps during or after placement. Some people might get medicine that either makes you relax or puts you to sleep completely. Some doctors or nurses also might inject or use a local numbing medicine around your cervix to make it more comfortable.

If you want to get any of these medicines when you get your IUD placed, you should talk to  your nurse or doctor before your appointment. You can let them know how you experience pain, any concerns you may have about getting the IUD placed, and if you would like to have medicines to manage the pain before, during, and/or after getting it placed. They can let you know what medicines they are able to offer you so you can decide if they are the nurse or doctor that you would like to get your IUD with.

Some people feel dizzy during or right after the IUD is put in, and there's a small chance of fainting. You might want to ask someone to come with you to the appointment so you don't have to drive or go home alone, and to give yourself some time to relax afterward.


## What can I expect after an IUD insertion procedure?

Many people feel perfectly fine right after they get an IUD, while others need to take it easy for a while. There can be some cramping and backaches, so plan on chilling at home after your appointment — it’s a great excuse to curl up on the couch with your favorite book or movie. Heating pads and over-the-counter pain meds can help ease cramps too.

You may have cramping and spotting after getting an IUD, but this almost always goes away within 3-6 months. Hormonal IUDs eventually make periods lighter and less crampy, and you might stop getting a period at all. On the flip side, copper IUDs may make periods heavier and cramps worse. For some people, this goes away over time. If your IUD is causing you pain, discomfort, or side effects you don’t like, call your doctor.

Once you get the IUD, a string about 1 or 2 inches long will come out of your cervix and into the top of your vagina; don’t worry, you won’t notice it. The string is there so a nurse or doctor can remove the IUD later. You can feel the string by putting your fingers in your vagina and reaching up toward your cervix. But DON’T tug on the string, because you could move your IUD out of place or pull it out.

There's a very small chance that your IUD could slip out of place. It can happen any time, but it's more common during the first 3 months. IUDs are most likely to come out during your period. Check your pads, tampons, or cups to see if it fell out. You can also check your string to make sure it’s still there. If your IUD falls out, you’re NOT protected from pregnancy, so make sure to go see your doctor, and use condoms or another kind of birth control in the meantime.

Remember when you got your IUD (or write it down somewhere), so you’ll know when it needs to be replaced. The Paragard IUD should be replaced after 12 years. Mirena should be replaced after 8 years. Kyleena should be replaced after 5 years. Liletta should be replaced after 8 years. Skyla should be replaced after 3 years.


## How soon after getting an IUD can I have sex?

You can have sex as soon as you want after getting an IUD.

You might need to use a backup method of birth control (like condoms) until the IUD starts to work — whether you're protected against pregnancy right away depends on what type of IUD you get and when it’s put in your uterus.

Paragard (copper), Mirena, and Liletta IUDs start working to prevent pregnancy as soon as they're in place.

Kyleena and Skyla IUDs start working to prevent pregnancy right away IF they’re put in during the first 7 days of your period. If you get a Kyleena or Skyla IUD at any other time during your cycle, protection starts after 7 days — in the meantime, use condoms or another kind of birth control to prevent pregnancy.
