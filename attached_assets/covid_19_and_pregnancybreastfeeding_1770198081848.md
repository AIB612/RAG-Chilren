- COVID-19 and Your Sexual Health
Scientists are still learning how COVID-19 affects pregnancy and a newborn baby’s health. But based on what scientists know right now, pregnant people have a higher risk of getting very sick and dying if they get COVID-19. Your chances of getting really sick, going to the hospital, getting long covid, or dying from COVID-19 are lower if you’ve been vaccinated and had boosters during or before your pregnancy.


## How does COVID-19 affect pregnancy?

People who are pregnant or have been pregnant recently are more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19 than people who aren’t pregnant. And pregnant people who have COVID-19 may have an increased risk of pregnancy complications, like early birth or stillbirth. Many pregnant people also get better without needing hospital care.

If you’re pregnant:


- Get the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters, and any other recommended vaccines (like the flu and Tdap vaccines). Ask anybody you live with to also get a flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine/boosters.
- Take steps to prevent coming into contact with COVID-19, like avoiding people who have COVID-19 or have recently been exposed to it, wearing a mask—especially when you’re in public spaces, near someone sick, or with groups of people— and washing your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds.
- Call a nurse or doctor right away if you think you have COVID-19 or have any other questions or concerns about your health.
Pregnant people without the COVID-19 vaccine are more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they get sick. Severe COVID-19 illness can lead to death. Read more about COVID-19 and pregnancy.


## How does COVID-19 affect newborns?

Some newborns have tested for COVID-19 soon after birth, but there is not enough research to show if they got the virus before, during, or after birth. Most babies who test positive for COVID-19 may show mild or no symptoms or get very sick, but a few get severely ill.

If you’re pregnant and have COVID-19 symptoms, or think you were exposed to COVID-19, talk with your nurse or doctor about getting tested for COVID-19 and how to stay safe and healthy. If anybody who lives with or cares for you and your baby has COVID-19, they should avoid being near your baby as much as possible.


## How does COVID-19 affect breastfeeding?

So far, scientists don’t know for sure if a baby can get COVID-19 through breast milk — the current research says it’s not likely.

If you’re feeling sick, think you have COVID-19, or have had contact with someone who has COVID-19, call your nurse or doctor for more information on how to safely care for yourself and your baby, including feeding your baby.

If you breastfeed and think you may have COVID-19, here are some steps you can take  to avoid spreading it to your baby:


- Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before feeding or pumping, and before you touch your baby or any breastfeeding equipment, like breast pumps and bottle parts.
- Clean and sanitize surfaces, bottles, and breast pump parts that you use to feed your baby.
- Don’t share your breast pump with other people.
- Wear a face mask while you’re breastfeeding or pumping. Don’t put a face mask or shield on your baby. It is dangerous and can suffocate or strangle them, or increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
- If possible, have someone who doesn’t have COVID-19 feed your baby with pumped breast milk. You can also ask anybody who feeds your baby to wear a mask while caring for your baby.
If you need help with food assistance and breastfeeding support, you can contact your local WIC program. If you’re an immigrant, WIC assistance doesn’t count against you when you apply for a green card or visa.


## Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I’m pregnant or breastfeeding?

Yes, it is safe and recommended. The CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine and its boosters for people who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, might become pregnant in the future, or are breastfeeding.

People who are pregnant or have been pregnant recently are more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19. And pregnant people who have COVID-19 may have a higher risk of pregnancy complications, like early birth or high blood pressure.

COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can help keep you and your baby healthier and safe.The COVID-19 vaccine is safe to get at any point in your pregnancy.

While scientists are still studying the COVID-19 vaccine, there’s some research showing that vaccinated people have COVID-19 antibodies in their breast milk — so it’s possible that getting the vaccine could pass some COVID-19 protection on to your baby.

You can read more about COVID-19 vaccine safety for pregnant and breastfeeding people on the CDC website.


## What should I do if I’m pregnant and get a fever after getting the vaccine?

If you get a fever after getting your vaccine, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) if you’re not allergic to it. Acetaminophen is safe to use when you’re pregnant. If you have any questions or concerns about COVID-19 vaccine side effects, call your nurse or doctor.


## Can COVID-19 cause a miscarriage?

COVID-19 can lead to serious health issues for some pregnant people, but there’s no evidence that it increases your risk for miscarriage. However, getting COVID-19 vaccine while you’re pregnant can increase your chances of having your baby early (preterm birth) and can lead to problems like high blood pressure or preeclampsia, which are risky during pregnancy.

Having COVID-19 while you’re pregnant won’t affect your fertility or lessen  your chances of getting pregnant in the future. The best way to protect yourself and your baby from COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. Getting the COVID-19 doesn’t increase your risk for miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, or birth defects. It’s safe to get vaccinated at any point in your pregnancy. Some of your nearest Planned Parenthood health centers can give you the COVID-19 vaccine, you can find out more by calling 1-800-230-7526.
