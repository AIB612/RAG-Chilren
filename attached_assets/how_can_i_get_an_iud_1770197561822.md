### Want an IUD?


## Just a couple more questions.

For more accurate abortion options, please enter your age and the first day of your last period. Your information is private and anonymous.


## How much does an IUD cost?

Getting an IUD costs anywhere between $0 to $1,800. That’s a pretty wide range, but the good news is that IUDs can be free or low cost with many health insurance plans and some other government programs.

Prices can also vary depending on which kind you get. The price of an IUD includes medical exams, getting the IUD put in, and follow-up visits.

Even if an IUD costs more than other methods up front, they usually end up saving you money in the long run because they last for years.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to see if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.


## Can I get an IUD for free or low-cost?

There's a good chance you can get an IUD for free (or for a reduced price) if you have health insurance. Most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control, including IUDs.

However, some plans don’t cover all brands of IUDs. Your health insurance provider can tell you which ones they pay for. Your doctor may also be able to help you get your birth control method of choice covered by health insurance. Learn more about health insurance and affordable birth control.

If you don't have health insurance, you've still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may qualify for state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept health insurance, and many charge less for services and birth control depending on your income. Contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center for more information.


## Where do I go to get an IUD?

An IUD has to be put in by a doctor, nurse, or other health care provider. You can contact your gynecologist, family planning clinics, or your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out more about getting an IUD.


## More questions from patients:

Someone asked us: How old do you have to be to get an IUD? And do you need parent permission to get an IUD?

There’s no age requirement to get an IUD. If your nurse or doctor says an IUD is safe for you, you can get one.

Most of the time, you don’t need parent permission to get birth control, like IUDs. But the laws are different in every state. There are certain places where your nurse or doctor can contact a parent or guardian if you’re under 18. You can ask about age requirements and privacy policies when you make an appointment.

If you use your family’s health insurance to pay for your IUD, they might get a statement in the mail that says what services you had. If you’re using someone else’s health insurance and you don’t want them to know about your doctor’s visit, call the insurance company to find out about their privacy policies. The number is usually on the back of your insurance card. You can also ask your nurse or doctor.

You can also call your local Planned Parenthood health center to see if they can give you free or low cost birth control, without using insurance. And some states have special programs that allow teens to get their own private health insurance plan for sexual health services, like birth control and STD testing. Your local Planned Parenthood can help you with that, too.

It’s normal to feel kind of awkward talking to a parent/caregiver about birth control, but they care about you and would probably like to be involved in your health, and they might even give you good advice and help you get the care you need. If you feel safe talking to them, here are some tips for starting the conversation.
