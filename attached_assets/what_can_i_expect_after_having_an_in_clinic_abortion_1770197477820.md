### Thinking about getting an abortion?


## Just a couple more questions.

## What happens after my abortion?

Right after your abortion, you’ll rest in a recovery room for up to around an hour. If you had any kind of sedation, you should have someone else help you get home safely. Plan on taking it easy for the rest of the day.

You can go back to work, school, driving, exercise, and most other normal activities the next day if you feel up to it. You can have sex as soon as you feel ready.

It’s normal to have some bleeding after an abortion. You can use pads, tampons, or a menstrual cup —  whatever's the most comfortable for you. But your nurse or doctor may recommend you use pads so you can track how much you're bleeding. You may have spotting for several weeks. And some people don’t bleed at all. All of this is normal.

You’ll get written information about what to expect and how to take care of yourself after your abortion. You’ll get a phone number you can call with any questions or concerns -- we’re here to help 24/7 after your abortion.

It’s important to take all of your antibiotics, no matter how you feel. Your doctor or nurse may want you to come back for a follow-up appointment in 2-4 weeks.

Most people don’t have any problems after their abortion, and recovery is usually quick and easy. But call your doctor right away if you:


- soak 2 maxi pads per hour for 2 hours

## How will I feel after my abortion?

It varies from person to person. You’ll probably have some bleeding and cramping after your abortion, so plan on resting in a comfortable place afterwards.

Most people are back to their regular activities within a day, but recovery after a D&E can take a little longer. You can take pain medication like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin). You can also put a heating pad or hot water bottle on your belly or have someone rub your back. If you’re not feeling well after a couple of days, call your doctor or nurse.

You may have a range of emotions after having an abortion. Studies show that most people feel relief, but sometimes people feel sad or regretful. Many people feel all these things together. However you feel is totally normal — everybody’s experience is different. But if your mood keeps you from doing the things you usually do each day, call your doctor or nurse for help. You can also call Exhale or All-Options for free, confidential, and non-judgmental emotional support after an abortion — no matter how you’re feeling.

## How will my abortion affect my periods?

Abortion starts a new menstrual cycle, so your period should go back to normal 4-8 weeks after your abortion. When your next period will come depends on the birth control method you use.

If you’re not on hormonal birth control, you should have a period by 8 weeks after your abortion. If you’re not using hormonal birth control and you don’t get your period 8 weeks after your abortion, call your doctor or health center.

Keep in mind that you can get pregnant very quickly after an abortion, even if your period isn't back to normal yet. So if you don’t want to get pregnant again, it’s a good idea to talk to your nurse or doctor about birth control.

You may have some bleeding right after your abortion that’s different than your period. You could have heavy bleeding with clots for a few days, or spotting for several weeks. You can use pads, tampons, or a menstrual cup —  whatever's the most comfortable for you. But your nurse or doctor may recommend you use pads so you can track how much you're bleeding. If you’re concerned about bleeding after your abortion, give your nurse or doctor a call.


## How soon can I have sex after an in-clinic abortion?

You can have sex as soon as you feel ready.


## When can I start using birth control after my abortion?

You can get pregnant right after your abortion, so it’s a good idea to talk with your nurse or doctor about birth control as soon as you can — they can help you find a method that’s right for you. You can start using birth control immediately after having an abortion.

Some doctors, abortion clinics, and Planned Parenthood health centers can put an IUD in your uterus right after your abortion, during the same procedure. This is really convenient because you’ll get super effective birth control without having to go to a separate appointment. Ask about getting an IUD at the same time as your abortion when you call to make your appointment.
