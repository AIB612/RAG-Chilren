There are lots of places to go for pregnancy care. Some clinics and Planned Parenthood health centers can give you low-cost or free prenatal care.

## Where can I go for a prenatal care visit?

Make an appointment with a doctor, midwife, or nurse for your care during pregnancy. Some people just go to their regular family doctor or obstetrician. Others choose to see a midwife or nurse practitioner who specializes in prenatal care. You can also get prenatal care at some [Planned Parenthood health centers](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center).

## How much does prenatal care cost?

The cost of prenatal care depends on where you go and whether you have insurance. The cost can also change if you need special testing or treatment.

Most insurance plans cover the cost of prenatal care. If you don’t have health insurance, you may be able to get low-cost or free prenatal care from [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center), community health centers, or other family planning clinics.

You might also qualify for health insurance through your state if you’re pregnant. Your local [Planned Parenthood health center](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center) can give you information about getting health insurance coverage and referrals for prenatal care.

Planned Parenthood works to bring you quality, affordable health care, whether or not you have insurance. If you’re worried about the cost of prenatal visits, [your local Planned Parenthood health center](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center) can help you find health care that fits your budget.
