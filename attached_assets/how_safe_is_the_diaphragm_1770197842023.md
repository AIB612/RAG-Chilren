## What are the risks of using a diaphragm?

Diaphragms are supposed to be used with spermicide for the best protection from pregnancy. For most people, using spermicide is totally safe. However, the chemical in most spermicides, nonoxynol-9, has some risks. If you use it many times a day, it can irritate your vagina and increase your risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. If you’re worried about the spread of STDs, use condoms along with your diaphragm and spermicide to protect yourself and your partners.

Some people who use diaphragms get urinary tract infections (UTIs) a lot. If this happens to you, check with your nurse or doctor — you may need a different size.

If you notice that your vagina feels sore or irritated after you use your diaphragm with spermicide, you may be sensitive to the spermicide or the material that the diaphragm is made of. You can try a different brand of spermicide and see if that makes a difference. If the irritation feels really bad or if switching brands doesn't help, talk to your doctor.

You should also talk to a nurse or doctor if:


- it burns when you urinate (pee)

These things may mean that you have an infection or something else is wrong. Most problems are easy to treat, so don’t stress out — just talk to your doctor as soon as you can.

You should also watch out for signs of toxic shock syndrome. It’s very rare, but take your diaphragm out and call your doctor right away if you notice:
