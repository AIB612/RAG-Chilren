## What are pads, tampons, period underwear, menstrual cups, and discs?

Pads, tampons, period underwear, cups, and discs let you go about your normal life during your period, without getting blood on your clothes or sheets. Tampons, cups, and discs go inside your vagina, pads are worn in your underwear, and you can wear period underwear instead of regular underwear on the days you have your period.

Pads (sometimes called sanitary pads) are narrow pieces of material that you stick to your underwear to soak up menstrual blood during your period. Some have flaps or “wings” that fold over the sides of your underwear to protect against leaks and stains as well as keep your pad in place. Some pads are made out of disposable materials — you use them once and throw them away. Other pads are made from fabric, and can be washed and reused.

Tampons are little plugs made of cotton that fit inside your vagina to soak up menstrual blood. Some tampons come with an applicator that helps you put in the tampon. Tampons have a string attached to the end, so you can easily pull them out.

Period underwear (AKA period panties) are just like regular underwear, except they have extra layers of fabric that absorb your menstrual blood. There are different kinds of period underwear for light, medium, or heavy flow days. You can wear period panties on their own, or with a tampon or menstrual cup.

Menstrual cups are shaped like little bells or bowls, and they’re made of rubber, silicone, or soft plastic. You wear the cup inside your vagina, and it collects menstrual blood. Most cups are reusable — you just empty it when you need to, wash it, and use it again. Other menstrual cups are disposable — you throw it away after one use or one period cycle.

If you have an IUD, don’t use a menstrual cup. Using a menstrual cup can cause your IUD to move out of place.

Menstrual discs are circular discs made of silicone or polyethylene. You wear the disc where your vaginal canal meets your cervix to collect menstrual blood. They’re typically used once, and can be worn for up to 12 hours, depending on how heavy your flow is.


## How does period protection feel and can it get lost inside me?

Tampons, cups, and discs can’t get stuck or lost inside you, and cannot move to another part of your body. The muscles in your vagina hold them in place (without you even knowing!), and they stay inside your body until you take them out. You shouldn’t feel them at all when they’re in the right spot. You can wear tampons, cups, and discs in the water, and during all kinds of sports and activities. Menstrual discs can be safely worn during sex. If any period protection feels annoying or uncomfortable, you can always talk to your nurse or doctor to help you decide what kind may be best for you. Sometimes it may take trying a few different products before finding out which one is right for you.


## What type of period protection is right for me?

It’s totally up to you! Think about your lifestyle and what will best fit your needs. It’s also helpful to try different products, or ask a friend or family member what has worked for them and why.

It’s common to use different things at different times during your period. For example, someone may use tampons during the day and pads at night. You can also wear period underwear, a pad, or a pantyliner (a thin pad) while you’re using a tampon, cup, or disc for backup protection in case of leaks. If you’re swimming or playing sports, you may use a tampon, cup, or disc because you can’t wear period underwear or a pad in the water, and pads can often move out of place when doing activities that involve a lot of moving around. Some people think wearing products that go inside your vagina are more comfortable and convenient, because they’re out of the way and you usually can’t feel them. Others feel like period underwear and pads are more comfortable, or they prefer period underwear or pads because they don’t want to put anything in their vagina. Many people like the convenience of products that you use once and throw away, like tampons and disposable pads. These are usually easier to find in stores, too. Others choose reusable protection, like menstrual cups, period underwear, or fabric pads, because they can save money and they’re better for the environment. Menstrual discs can be disposable or reusable, depending on the brand you choose.

Avoid scented tampons or pads, vaginal deodorants, or douches — as they can lead to irritation or infections. Some people worry about the way their period smells, but chances are that no one will be able to tell that you have your period. Just make sure to change your pad, tampon, period underwear, disc, or cup as often as it is fully soaked or filled with blood.
